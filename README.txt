You can run the executable(named proj1) in the way I used in the report, like:
./proj1 inputfile.txt dfs
./proj1 inputfile.txt bfs
./proj1 inputfile.txt ucs
./proj1 inputfile.txt gs
./proj1 inputfile.txt as

You can compile the source code in order to create an executable, like:
g++ -o executablename kod.cpp
